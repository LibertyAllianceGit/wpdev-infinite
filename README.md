Hello there! I'm an awesome plugin that allows you to easily install a fresh, new take on infinite scroll. This version makes it easy to use ads and analytics, without complicated JavaScript. It also gives your readers control over where they go, all while nudging them along to read more. We recommend the following plugin to help you prefetch the next post, for faster loading during infinite scroll: https://wordpress.org/plugins/instant-articles/.

---------------

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Configure via the WPDev Infinite options page in the dashboard.
